this project is an exercise while learning fullstack.
this uses html, css, js, node.js, express, npm, jquery, ejs, body-parser, morgan, nodemon and maybe some more npm packages.

this website is an articles website, maybe in future it will be a posts website or a blog.
currently only text is supported (no photos or videos).

the homepage is a feed with all posts in random order (todo: sort options).
we can add new post, edit post, delete post.

there's a steaky navbar and many styling items and css code.
most of it is using flexbox.
this site is very responsive to screen sizes in desktop and mobile.

there is a button to expand/collapse all posts in the feed (see only titles or content as well).
clicking on a title will expand/collapse the specific article.

there are button to quickly test the site and it's responsiveness via creating random posts in several sizes. from small to large.

todo:

- support line breaks, paragraphs and special chars in article text.
- support 'sort' in the feed
- support photos in article (1 cover photo per article or many photos freely between article's text?)
